# For a given positive integer n determine if it can be represented as a sum of two Fibonacci numbers (possibly equal).
#
# Example
#
# For n = 1, the output should be
# fibonacciSimpleSum2(n) = true.
#
# Explanation: 1 = 0 + 1 = F0 + F1.
#
# For n = 11, the output should be
# fibonacciSimpleSum2(n) = true.
#
# Explanation: 11 = 3 + 8 = F4 + F6.
#
# For n = 60, the output should be
# fibonacciSimpleSum2(n) = true.
#
# Explanation: 11 = 5 + 55 = F5 + F10.
#
# For n = 66, the output should be
# fibonacciSimpleSum2(n) = false.
