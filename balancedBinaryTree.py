# Codewriting
# You are given a binary tree and you need to write a function that can determine if it is height-balanced.
#
# A height-balanced tree can be defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by a maximum of 1.
#
# Example 1:
# Given the following tree [5,10,25,None,None,12,3]:
#
#     5
#    / \
#  10  25
#     /  \
#    12   3
# return True.
#
# Example 2:
# Given the following tree [5,6,6,7,7,None,None,8,8]:
#
#        5
#       / \
#      6   6
#     / \
#    7   7
#   / \
#  8   8
