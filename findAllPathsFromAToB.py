# You are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that contains N nodes.
#
# Write a function that can find all the possible paths from node 0 to node N - 1. You can return the path in any order.
#
# graph[a] is a list of all nodes b for which the edge a -> b exists.
#
# Example:
# Graph illustration
#
# Input: graph = [[1, 2],[3],[3],[4],[]]
# Output: [[0,1,3,4], [0,2,3,4]]
