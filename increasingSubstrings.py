# You have a string s. Split s into the minimum possible number of increasing substrings. A substring is considered to be increasing when the next symbol in the substring is also next in the English alphabet. This is case sensitive, i.e. 'b' is next for 'a' but 'C' is not next for 'b'. Return an array of these substrings.
#
# Example
#
# For s = "ABCDEFFDEfghCBA", the output should be
# increasingSubstrings(s) = ["ABCDEF", "F", "DE", "fgh", "C", "B", "A"].
