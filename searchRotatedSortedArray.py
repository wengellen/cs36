# Given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.
#
# Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
#
# You should search for target in nums and if found return its index, otherwise return -1.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [6,7,0,1,2,3,4,5], target = 0
# Output: 2
#
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [6,7,0,1,2,3,4,5], target = 3
# Output: 5
#
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [1], target = 0
# Output: -1
