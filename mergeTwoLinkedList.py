# Note: Your solution should have O(l1.length + l2.length) time complexity, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.
#
# Given two singly linked lists sorted in non-decreasing order, your task is to merge them. In other words, return a singly linked list, also sorted in non-decreasing order, that contains the elements from both original lists.
#
# Example
#
# For l1 = [1, 2, 3] and l2 = [4, 5, 6], the output should be
# mergeTwoLinkedLists(l1, l2) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
# For l1 = [1, 1, 2, 4] and l2 = [0, 3, 5], the output should be
# mergeTwoLinkedLists(l1, l2) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].


# Singly-linked lists are already defined with this interface:
# class ListNode(object):
#   def __init__(self, x):
#     self.value = x
#     self.next = None
#
def mergeTwoLinkedLists(l1, l2):
