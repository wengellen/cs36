# Given a positive integer number n, your task is to calculate the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.
#
# Note: The order matters; the answer should be of the form product - sum (and not sum - product).
#
# Example
#
# For n = 123456, the output should be digitsManipulations(n) = 699.
#
# The product of the digits is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720.
# The sum of the digits is equal to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.
# So the final answer is 720 - 21 = 699.
#
# For n = 1010, the output should be digitsManipulations(n) = -2.
#
# The multiplication of the digits is equal to 1 * 0 * 1 * 0 = 0.
# The sum of the digits is equal to 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2.
# So the final answer is 0 - 2 = -2.
