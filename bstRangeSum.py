#
# Binary trees are already defined with this interface:
# class Tree(object):
#   def __init__(self, x):
#     self.value = x
#     self.left = None
#     self.right = None
#
# You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST).
#
# You need to write a function that returns the sum of values of all the nodes with a value between lower and upper (inclusive).
#
# The BST is guaranteed to have unique values.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# root = [10, 5, 15, 3, 7, null, 18]
# lower = 7
# upper = 15
#
#          10
#          / \
#         5  15
#        / \    \
#       3   7    18
#
# Output:
# 32
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6]
# lower = 6
# upper = 10
#
#            10
#           /  \
#        5       15
#      / \     /   \
#     3   7  13   18
#    /   /
#   1   6
#
# Output:
# 23
