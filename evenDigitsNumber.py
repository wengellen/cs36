# Given an array of positive integers a, your task is to calculate how many of its elements have an even number of digits.
#
# Example
#
# For a = [12, 134, 111, 1111, 10], the output should be evenDigitsNumber(a) = 3.
#
# a[0] = 12 has 2 digits, which is an even number.
# a[1] = 134 has 3 digits, which is not an even number.
# a[2] = 111 has 3 digits, which is not an even number.
# a[3] = 1111 has 4 digits, which is an even number.
# a[4] = 10 has 2 digits, which is an even number.
# There are 3 elements (a[0], a[3], and a[4]) with an even number of digits, so the answer is 3.
