# You are given a string s, which consists only of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the number of adjacent triplets of unique characters within s. In other words, count the number of indices i, such that s[i], s[i + 1], and s[i + 2] are all pairwise distinct.
#
# Example
#
# For s = "abcdaaae", the output should be threeCharsDistinct(s) = 3.
#
# If i = 0, s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'b', and s[2] = 'c', which are pairwise distinct;
# If i = 1, s[1] = 'b', s[2] = 'c', and s[3] = 'd', which are pairwise distinct;
# If i = 2, s[2] = 'c', s[3] = 'd', and s[4] = 'a', which are pairwise distinct;
# If i = 3, s[3] = 'd', s[4] = 'a', and s[5] = 'a', which are not pairwise distinct because s[4] and s[5] are equal;
# If i = 4, s[4] = 'a', s[5] = 'a', and s[6] = 'a', which are not pairwise distinct because all pairs of characters are equal;
# If i = 5, s[5] = 'a', s[6] = 'a', and s[7] = 'e', which are not pairwise distinct because s[5] and s[6] are equal.
# If i = 6 or i = 7, at least one of characters s[i + 1] or s[i + 2] won't exist.
# For s = "abacaba", the output should be threeCharsDistinct(s) = 2.
#
# There are only 2 indices meeting the criteria:
#
# i = 1: s[1] = 'b', s[2] = 'a', and s[3] = 'c';
# i = 3: s[3] = 'c', s[4] = 'a', and s[5] = 'b'.
# All other triplets will contain more than one a character.
